  "description": "The surface looks busy, but everything else is still. White bubbles stack under clear ice as if time stalled halfway through a reaction. Unusual? Yes. Mysterious?

It is located in the 'Kootenay Plains area of the Canadian Rockies' front range,' where winter captures gas in mid-escape.",
