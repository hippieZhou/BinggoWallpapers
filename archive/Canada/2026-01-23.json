  "description": "When January's chill grips Iceland, locals turn to warmth and tradition with Þorrablót—a midwinter festival rooted in Viking heritage. Named after Þorri, a winter figure from Norse mythology, this celebration began as a sacrificial feast to honour the gods and ensure survival through harsh winters. Today, it's a lively cultural event that blends history with hearty camaraderie.",
