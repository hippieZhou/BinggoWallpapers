  "description": "One moment the canopy is still, and the next, a burst of black and white shoots through it like a living exclamation mark. That's the black-and-white ruffed lemur, a primate that doesn't shy away from announcing itself with raucous\u202Fcalls. Its coat comes in bold patches, and the thick ruff frames its face. Roughly 92% of the lemur's diet is fruit, with leaves, nectar, seeds and the occasional fungus making up the rest. When trees are heavy with figs and other seasonal offerings, this creature moves quickly through the dense forest. As it laps up nectar, pollen sticks to its snout, turning it into one of the habitat's most effective pollinators.",
