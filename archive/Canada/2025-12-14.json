  "description": "Each December, thousands swap wrapping paper for binoculars and step outside for a different kind of holiday tradition: the Christmas Bird Count. Started in 1900 by ornithologist Frank M. Chapman, the count offered a peaceful alternative to the Christmas 'side hunts,' where people competed to shoot the most animals. Chapman had a better idea: to count them instead. Over a century later, that simple shift has grown into the world's longest-running citizen-science project.",
