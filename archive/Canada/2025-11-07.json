  "description": "What's drawing scientists, travellers and cameras to Manitoba, this week? Polar Bear Week is here, and it's more than a date on the calendar. For over a decade, Polar Bears International—a non-profit organisation—has invited people to stream live cams and follow daily updates as the bears head to Hudson Bay. It's a week of learning and a call to protect a fragile ecosystem.",
