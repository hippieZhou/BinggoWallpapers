  "description": "Kings Mountain in Chugach Mountains of Alaska, United States, isn't just another bump on the horizon—it's the kind of rugged beauty that makes you slow down and stare. Rising over 1,700 metres and sitting roughly 22 miles northeast of Palmer, this peak towers over mile 75 of the Glenn Highway, a route famous for its dramatic scenery. Its slopes bear the marks of ancient glaciers, etched into ridges and valleys that seem tailor-made for adventure.",
