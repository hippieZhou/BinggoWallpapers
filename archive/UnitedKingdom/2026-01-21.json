  "description": "Today's image shows a Eurasian red squirrel perched in the snow, displaying the winter fur and tufted ears that make this species so striking. Native to forests across Europe and parts of Asia, red squirrels rely on seeds, nuts and fungi, stashing food in scattered caches and building nests high in hollow trees to survive the colder months.",
