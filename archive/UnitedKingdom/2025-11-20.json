  "description": "If you think art belongs only on walls, Swiss-–French artist Saype would like to draw your attention elsewhere—to the ground beneath your feet. In Geneva, Switzerland, he turned an ordinary patch of grass into an extraordinary message with his art, 'World in Progress,' which is featured in today's image. Look more closely, and you'll spot the artist himself posing with his artwork.",
