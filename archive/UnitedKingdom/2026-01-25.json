  "description": "Each January 25, Scots and friends around the world raise a toast to Robert Burns, Scotland's beloved national poet. A Burns Night supper blends warmth and wit: the centrepiece is haggis, a savoury pudding made from minced meat, oats and spices, served with neeps (mashed turnips) and tatties (mashed potatoes). Add plenty of good cheer, readings of Burns's verse and a dram of whisky, and you have a celebration that ends with a rousing chorus of 'Auld Lang Syne.'",
