  "description": "Exit Highway 101, and Bandon, in Oregon, United States, greets visitors with salty air and the gentle clang of harbour bells. The town began as a small settlement in the 1850s and grew into a centre for timber and salmon fishing. Cranberries became a key crop and are still celebrated each September during the Cranberry Festival. Old Town reflects that past with boardwalk cafés and galleries, while the Coquille River Lighthouse stands restored at Bullards Beach as a reminder of the days when its beacon guided ships.",
