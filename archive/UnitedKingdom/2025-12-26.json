  "description": "The best thing about Boxing Day is that it doesn't ask much of you. No big countdown. No dramatic unwrapping. No last-minute dashes for batteries. It's a rare holiday that says, 'Sit down, finish your leftovers and take a moment.' Celebrated on December 26 in the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries, it's a national cool-down after Christmas has done all the heavy lifting. The term goes back to Victorian Britain, when households prepared Christmas boxes for workers and tradespeople—tokens of thanks that ranged from coins to essentials. Churches joined in by opening alms boxes and distributing donations.",
