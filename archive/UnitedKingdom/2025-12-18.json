  "description": "Rock layers formed over millions of years and a massive bend in the Earth's crust give this desert a rare window into geologic history. This is Capitol Reef National Park in Utah, United States, where sandstone cliffs and canyons preserve a striking record of the planet's past. December 18 marks the anniversary of its designation as a national park in 1971. Today's featured image highlights the sandstone monoliths of Cathedral Valley, including the Temple of the Sun, part of this extraordinary, protected landscape.",
