  "description": "1 March is the day Wales politely clears its throat and makes its point. No fireworks, no fanfare—just hymns, dragons and a nation confidently wearing vegetables.

Saint David was a 6th-century preacher and monastic founder whose advice to 'do the little things' still does the rounds on banners, mugs and moral compasses.",
