  "description": "In England there is a day called Boxing Day that follows Christmas and its charm lies in how quietly it arrives. No countdowns. No frantic unwrapping. Just a pause on 26 December after the festive rush for families and friends alike. The tradition began in Victorian Britain when households prepared Christmas boxes for workers and tradespeople offering coins or essentials as gestures of thanks. Churches opened their alms boxes as well turning the day into one of small thoughtful giving and shared goodwill.",
