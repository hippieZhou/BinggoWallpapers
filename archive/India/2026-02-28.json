  "description": "Big ears. Wrinkled skin. A giant shadow that seems to move on its own. Today's image captures a heart-melting moment between an African elephant calf and its mother in Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve. The Masai Mara spans 1,510 square kilometres, forming part of the wider Mara–Serengeti ecosystem. Think the reserve is only about elephants? Think again. It's famed for wildebeest migrations and dense wildlife.",
