  "description": "Colour feels at home in Olinda. The house seen in today's image, painted in bold, joyful tones, reflects a city where history and creativity live side by side. Founded in the 16th century in Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil, Olinda grew from a colonial stronghold into a cultural landmark shaped by Portuguese architecture, Afro-Brazilian traditions and centuries of artistic expression. Its hills are lined with pastel facades, baroque churches and narrow cobblestone streets that seem designed for wandering rather than rushing.",
