  "description": "On Oregon's coast in the United States, Bandon greets visitors with salty air and the gentle clang of harbour bells. The town began as a small settlement in the 1850s and grew into a centre for timber and salmon fishing. Its maritime past endures in the restored Coquille River Lighthouse, whose beacon once guided ships safely to shore.",
