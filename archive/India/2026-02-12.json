  "description": "Before bridges, rivers set the pace of travel. Now, with bridges, people do. That shift explains why cross-border links like the Third Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge connecting Laos and Thailand matter. Bridges come in many forms, each built to meet a specific challenge. Arch bridges manage compression, suspension bridges span long distances and concrete box-girder bridges prioritise stability and load efficiency. This bridge uses the box-girder design, making it a practical choice for crossing the wide, fast-moving Mekong River.",
