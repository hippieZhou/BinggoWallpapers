  "description": "As Christmas draws near, star lanterns\u202Fbegin\u202Fto appear\u202Feverywhere—twinkling\u202Ffrom balconies, shining in shop windows and lighting up market stalls.\u202FTheir shimmer cuts through the long winter nights, filling streets and homes with joy, colour and a sense of togetherness.\u202FBut\u202Fbehind these\u202Ffestive\u202Fdecorations lies a story as captivating as their glow. The first of these stars\u202Femerged\u202Fin\u202FNiesky, Germany, in the early 1800s. Students at a Moravian Church boarding school crafted what we now call the Herrnhut Star or Moravian Star, during a geometry lesson. That geometric marvel, crafted from paper and\u202Fcardboard, soon came to symbolise the Star of Bethlehem and the spirit of Advent.\u202FBy 1897, Pieter Verbeek, a former student of that school, began producing and selling them. His son Harry later continued the tradition, founding the Herrnhut Star Factory in 1925.",
