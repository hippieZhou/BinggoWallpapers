  "description": "Milwaukee City Hall, in the state of Wisconsin, United States, is one of the city's most recognisable landmarks. Completed in 1895, this towering Flemish Renaissance Revival masterpiece\u202Fdoesn't\u202Fjust dominate the skyline; it\u202Fdefines\u202Fit. For\u202Fnearly eight\u202Fdecades, it stood as the city's tallest building, a title it proudly held until 1973.\u202FDesigned by architect Henry C. Koch, this hall blends German-inspired architecture with Milwaukee's own historic influences. That connection\u202Fisn't\u202Faccidental—its design pays tribute to the city's strong German heritage, which shaped much of the surrounding neighbourhood as well.",
