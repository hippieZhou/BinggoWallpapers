  "description": "Some bridges connect two sides. Tower Bridge connects history, engineering and a flair for drama. Standing next to the Tower of London and rising over the River Thames since 1894, this London icon knows how to lift spirits—and traffic. With its twin towers, blue-and-white paintwork and bascules that open like a giant's drawbridge, Tower Bridge is less a traffic solution and more a stage performer. For many Indians, Tower Bridge isn't just a London landmark—it's a Bollywood favourite. Scenes from 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' and 'Namastey London' have used the bridge as a backdrop for romance and departure, making it instantly recognisable even to those who've never visited England.",
