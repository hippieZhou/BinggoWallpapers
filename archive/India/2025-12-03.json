  "description": "Indian naval ships once moved across the Arabian Sea under cover of night in December 1971 during the Indo-Pak War. Their course led toward Karachi, a crucial port for fuel and supplies. Indian missile boats carried out a carefully planned mission and returned home unharmed, shifting the tide of the conflict and marking a defining moment at sea. It remains one of the most significant chapters in India's maritime story.",
