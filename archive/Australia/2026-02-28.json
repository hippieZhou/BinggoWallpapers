  "description": "Moloka'i, often called the most Hawaiian of the islands, offers a slower rhythm shaped by nature and strong community ties. Formed by volcanic activity more than a million years ago, the island covers about 670 square kilometres and rises from the Pacific Ocean in long ridges and broad valleys. Unlike its busier neighbours, Moloka'i has resisted large-scale development, preserving a strong sense of local cohesion where families, traditions and stewardship of the land encapsulate central values. Life here focuses on the ocean, the land and stories passed down through generations.",
