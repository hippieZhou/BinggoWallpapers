  "description": "In the summer heat of 1963, a quarter of a million people gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, for one of the largest demonstrations in our history. Segregation still dictated where people could live, learn, vote, and work; the nation simmered with tension—and the world was watching. At that moment, Martin Luther King, Jr. stepped forward, a Baptist minister and the strategic heart of the civil rights movement. He fought injustice with discipline, clarity, and nonviolent resolve, delivering a vision that reshaped the nation's imagination: a future where freedom was real, dignity was universal, and justice extended to all.",
