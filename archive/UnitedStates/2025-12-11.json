  "description": "Every December 11, we celebrate International Mountain Day, honoring the majestic peaks that shape our planet and the glaciers that support life. From the rolling Alps to the towering Himalayas, mountains cover nearly a quarter of Earth's land and host 15% of the world's population and nearly half of its biodiversity hotspots. Mount Everest, the world's highest peak at over 29,000 feet, stands as a symbol of human aspiration and natural beauty. Its glaciers feed rivers sustaining millions, showing that mountains are more than scenery—they are lifelines.",
