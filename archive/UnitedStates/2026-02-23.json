  "description": "The great egret is a striking large heron, easily recognizable by its pure white plumage, long neck, and sharp yellow bill. Known for its cosmopolitan distribution, it occupies habitats around the world and adapts well to many aquatic environments. Adults measure about 37 to 41 inches in body length, with a wingspan of 4.3 to 4.8 feet, and weigh about 2.2 pounds, giving them a tall, elegant silhouette—roughly chest‑high when compared to a 6‑foot-tall person. As carnivores, they feed primarily on fish but also take amphibians, insects, small mammals, and occasionally reptiles. Their patient hunting style, standing motionless before striking with sudden precision, is one of their most distinctive traits.",
