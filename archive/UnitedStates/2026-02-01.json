  "description": "Some months arrive quietly, but February knocks on the door, flips on the spotlight, and says, 'Let's give credit where it's long overdue.' That's the spirit of Black History Month—a time to celebrate African American achievements, confront hard truths, and honor those who shaped the country. It began in 1926 when historian Carter G. Woodson launched Negro History Week. The week grew, spread through schools and communities, and by 1976 it officially expanded into a month.",
