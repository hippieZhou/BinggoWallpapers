  "description": "Ever felt as if the night just wouldn't end? That's the winter solstice working its magic. It is the shortest day and longest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, occurring around December 21 or 22. In the Southern Hemisphere, the same happens around June 21 or 22. It marks the moment when one of Earth's poles tilts farthest from the sun. From that instant, daylight slowly begins to lengthen again.",
